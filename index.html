    <h1>About Max</h1>
    <p>
      I grew up just outside of Des Moines, Iowa, in a town called Waukee. I am
      20 years old with two siblings. I have worked as a basketball referee, pro
      shop and golf cart attendant, landscaper, computer lab monitor, bartender,
      and as a wealth management intern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am pursuing a degree in finance and business analytics. Through
      coursework and my internship last summer, I have decided I would like to
      pursue a career in wealth management.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy all things health and fitness, golfing, college
      basketball, reading, and, of course, spending time with friends and
      family.
