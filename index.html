      <h1>About Max</h1>
      <p>
        I grew up just outside of Des Moines, Iowa, in a town called Waukee. I
        am 20 years old with two siblings. I have worked as a basketball
        referee, pro shop and golf cart attendant, landscaper, computer lab
        monitor, bartender, and as a wealth management intern.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am pursuing a degree in finance and business analytics. Through
        coursework and my internship last summer, I have decided I would like to
        pursue a career in wealth management.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy all things health and fitness, golfing, college
        basketball, reading, and, of course, spending time with friends and
        family. I enoy to travel as well and hope to do more of that when I
        graduate college!
